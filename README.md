# TableFetch

1. Extract / download index.html, datatabl.js, js.js and style.css to same folder.
2. Open index.html and wait until page is loaded (might take a while due to synchronous data fetch)
3. You have now full operatable table, to see company details click Details on selected company row
4. To calculate Total income and Average income fo selected data range: fill form with company ID and selected date range and click button    Calc. You should see a modal with calculated data.

5. I know that it should work faster, but I just have started to learn Front-end tech, most things was completly new for me :)
